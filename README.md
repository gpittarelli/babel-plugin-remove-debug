# babel-plugin-remove-debug

Removes usage of the popular [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) library from code.

The following:

```javascript
import foo from './foo';
import Debug from 'debug';
const debug = Debug('bar');
const debug1 = require('debug')('tag1');

function bar(x, debug1) {
   let val = {
    debug: debug,
    debug1
   }
   debug('Doing something');
   debug1('Doing something');
   foo(1, x);
}



```

will be transformed into:

```javascript
import foo from './foo';

function bar(x, ()={}) {
   let val = {
    debug: ()=>{},
    debug1:  ()=>{}
   }
   foo(1, x);
}
```

This is useful to help save on bundle size and be sure that log messages aren't being shown to clients. It also makes it safe to leave in potentially-expensive logging messages for development and be confident they won't impact production runtimes at all.

## Limitations

- Doesn't do any particularly advanced flow analysis -- if you do weird things like aliasing the value you import from `debug`, the best we can do is replace the import with a dummy assignment instead of totally removing it.  (eg `import Debug from 'debug'; const x = Debug; x('hi')('yo');` will be safely neutered but won't be reduced to nothing even though it theoretically could. Notably, all the arguments in the `x('hi')('yo')` line will still be evaluated.)

## Options

A typical setup

    {
        "plugins": ["babel-plugin-remove-debug"]
    }

By default this will apply to all import of `'debug'`. If you are using a compatible but differently named package, or otherwise have the import name aliased, you can specify that using the `libraries` option. It accepts an array of regular expressions (as strings). For example:

    {
        "plugins": [
            ["babel-plugin-remove-debug", {
               "libraries": [
                 "^debug$",
                 "^@mycompany/debug-fork-(1|2|3)$"
               ]
            }]
        ]
    }
